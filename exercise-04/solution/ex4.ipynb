        "1. Load and preprocess a text dataset\n",

        "3. Batch generation for training (6 points)\n",
        "4. Defining the character-level LSTM model (6 points)\n",
        "5. Training loop (3 points)\n",

        "### 3. Batch Generation for Training (6 points)\n",
        "In this step, you will implement the function `get_batches()` that splits the encoded data into smaller batches for training. Each batch will have input sequences `x` and target sequences `y` where `y` is `x` shifted by one position.  This means that the model is trained to generate the next character in the sequence based on the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Steps to follow:\n",
        "##### 1. Handle step_size:\n",
        "The step size determines how much the window moves across the data after each sequence is generated. If `step_size` is not provided, it is set to `seq_length`. This means the sequences will not overlap. A smaller `step_size` allows for overlapping sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 2. Calculate the number of batches:\n",
        "When calculating how many batches you can generate from the input data, there are some key factors to consider:\n",
        "1. Sequence Length: Each input sequence in a batch will contain a specific number of tokens (representing the characters). The longer your sequence length is, the fewer total sequences you can generate from the input data.\n",
        "2. Step Size: A smaller step size results in more overlap between sequences and it allows you to generate more sequences from the same input. If the step size is larger, there will be less overlap (or none at all if step size equals sequence length), leading to fewer sequences in total.\n",
        "3. Batch Size: Once you generate sequences, you need to group them into batches for efficient training. The batch size defines how many sequences are grouped in each batch. A larger batch size means fewer batches because more sequences are grouped together in each batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure to generate full number of batches.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3. Trim the input array:\n",
        "If the input data does not perfectly divide into batches, trim the array so it contains only full batches. Avoid having incomplete sequences at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 4. Generate batches:\n",
        "Use nested loops to generate batches:\n",
        "- `x` will be the input sequence of length `seq_length`.\n",
        "- `y` will be target sequence, which is `x` shifted by one position (token).\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 5. Store and return batches:\n",
        "Store the input and target sequences in separate arrays (`x_batches` and `y_batches`) and return them as NumPy arrays to be used in training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expected Shape**:\n",
        "- Each batch in `x_batches` and `y_batches` should have the shape `(batch_size, seq_length)`.\n",
        "- The returned `x_batches` and `y_batches` should be NumPy arrays with shapes `(num_batches, batch_size, seq_length)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Notes**:\n",
        "- Support for both overlapping and non-overlapping sequences using `step_size`.\n",
        "- Handle edge cases where the data does not fit perfectly into full batches.\n",

        "In this step, you will implement the CharLSTM class, which processes sequences of characters and predicts the next character in the sequence. The model will learn sequential patterns in the data and store information over time using hidden states.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Key Components:\n",
        "##### 1. Single Multi-Layer LSTM (see [nn.LSTM](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html)):\n",
        "- Use a single `nn.LSTM` module configured as a multi-layer LSTM by setting the `num_layers` parameter to specify the number of stacked layers within this LSTM.\n",
        "- Dropout set in `nn.LSTM` automatically applies dropout between the internal LSTM layers (e.g., between the 1st and 2nd layers if num_layers=2). This dropout is only applied between the internal LSTM layers and does not affect the final output layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 2. Dropout Layer (see [nn.Dropout](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html)):\n",
        "- Define an additional dropout layer to be applied after the final LSTM layer. This helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3. Fully Connected Layer (see [nn.Linear](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html)):\n",
        "- After the LSTM layers, a fully connected layer maps the hidden states to process them as a probability distribution over the vocabulary to predict the next character in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 4. Hidden State Initialization:\n",
        "- The LSTM's hidden and cell states will be initialized with zero values before each batch is processed and will be updated as the model processes the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Steps to follow:\n",
        "- You need to implement the following methods in the `CharLSTM` class:\n",
        "   - `__init__()` to define the architecture.\n",
        "   - `forward()` to handle the forward pass.\n",
        "   - `init_hidden()` to initialize the hidden and cell states before each batch.\n",
        "- The model architecture should follow this flow:\n",
        "    - One `nn.LSTM`: Define a single multilayer LSTM with `num_layers=num_layers`, output dimensionality `hidden_dim`, and internal dropout of `dropout_prob` between stacked layers.\n",
        "    - Dropout after LSTM: Apply a separate dropout layer `nn.Dropout` with the probability of `dropout_prob` to the LSTM’s output after all layers.\n",
        "    - Fully Connected Layer: Define a fully connected layer to output logits for each character in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Notes**:\n",
        "- Ensure that you use the provided parameters (e.g., num_layers, hidden_dim) when defining the model architecture. Avoid hardcoding values (like `num_layers=2`)\n",
        "- One-hot encoding will be applied in the training loop before the data is passed to the model. This will adjust the shape of x for each batch to `(batch_size, seq_length, input_dim)`, where input_dim is the vocabulary size.  You do not need to handle this encoding within the CharLSTM class.\n",
        "- We will use cross-entropy loss as the loss function. The cross-entropy loss combines the softmax operation and the negative log-likelihood loss in a single step. The loss function takes the raw outputs (logits) from the fully connected layer and internally converts them to a probability distribution. Therefore, you do not need to apply Softmax separately.\n",
        "- Ensure the hidden states are initialized on the same device as the model parameters to avoid device mismatch errors.\n",
        "- Make sure to configure the LSTM as one `nn.LSTM` module with `num_layers` rather than separate layers. This approach is critical for testing.\n",
        "- Do not confuse stacked LSTM (configured with `num_layers`) with bidirectional LSTM.\n",
        "- Carefully check LSTM parameters and make sure that input and output shapes are correct. Pay special attention to the difference between batched and unbatched input shapes.\n",
        "- Consider how `batch_first` parameter of `nn.LSTM` aligns with the shape of your data after one-hot encoding and think about how the batch dimension should be treated within the LSTM."
